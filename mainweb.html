    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <span>C# is pronounced as “C-Sharp”. It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework. Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language. It is based on C++ and Java, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component-oriented programming approach. C# has evolved much since their first release in the year 2002. It was introduced with .NET Framework 1.0 and the current version of C# is 5.0. 
        Features:
        Type-Safe.
        Component Oriented.

        7. CoffeeScript Language
        CoffeeScript is a lightweight language based on Ruby and Python which transcompiles (compiles from one source language to another) into JavaScript. It provides better syntax avoiding the quirky parts of JavaScript, still retaining the flexibility and beauty of the language.
        Features:
        Class-Based Inheritance.)
        main = putStrLn "Hello World"
        11. Pascal Language
        Pascal, a computer programming language developed about 1970 by Niklaus Wirth of Switzerland to teach structured programming, which emphasizes the orderly use of conditional and loop control structures without GOTO statements.
        Pascal is a Strongly Typed Language.
        It Supports Structured Programming Through Functions and Procedures. 
        Hello World in Pascal:
        
        program Hello;
        begin
          writeln ('Hello, world.');
        end.
        12. Ruby Language
        Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan. Ruby is open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license.  
        
        Features:
        Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.
        Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
         Hello World in Ruby:
        
        puts 'Hello World'
        Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. 
        Features:
        GUI Programming Support.
        Dynamically Typed Language.
        Hello World in Python:
        print("Hello World")
        14. Assembly Language
        Stan Poley wrote the Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program or SOAP assembly language for the IBM 650 computer in 1955. Assembly languages started being used widely as they relieved the programmers from tedious tasks such as remembering numeric codes. 
        Features:
        64-bit Address Space.
